In this project, an Active Learning model was developed, and it works as a medical diagnosis model with a neural network classifier. This study was conducted using Python (4.2.5) and Active Learning through the modAL library (0.4.1). 

To execute this program, some libraries are required, namely: pandas (1.1.5), numpy (1.19.5), torch (1.10.0), skorch (0.11.0), modAL (0.4.1), os (0.6.2), matplotlib (3.2.2), math (1.2.1), sklearn (1.0.1), tabulate (0.8.9) and statistics. Those versions are indicated due to the fact they do not have any incompatibility between themself. 

If you are trying to execute the version .py, we recommend that you put the dataset at the same directory as the code. The following command should be run in a terminal (Anaconda prompt or Python, itself):

	pip install modAL
	pip install skorch
	pip install torch

If you execute the version .ipynb, we also recommend that you maintain the datasets in the same folder as your code. In case the datasets and code are not in the same folder, the path can be changed at cell 5. In order to run the program, is not necessary to install any package separately, those commands are already on the first cells.
